## What is Git and why is GitHub useful?
Though often used synonymously, Git and GitHub are two different things. Git is a version control system, a tool to manage your source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. In essence, Git is the tool, and GitHub is the service for projects that use Git (or a range of other kinds of software/documents/files/etc.). 

## Why don't we just use DropBox or Google Drive? 
1. Language: GitHub can read both text and programming languages, which improves sharing/editing capabilities in comparisson to solely text-based resource. 
2. Version Control: You've probably heard me say this a couple times and wondered what I mean: GitHub allows you to see and edit a project at different forms of completion, which enables multiple individuals to work on tasks at various times, while seeing eachother's work and reviewing any and all changes before they are made. 
3. Documentation: GitHub is built on the principle of being able to see the full history of a project, and thus it allows for more complete documentation than other file sharing/editing platforms
